# Gradius | The Flappy Bird edition
Programming Project Advanced Programming UAntwerp 2Ba

## Dependencies
You will need to have **SFML 2.3** or above installed on your computer, otherwise the game won't run. 

## How to install
To play the game, you just need to run the ```run.sh``` script. 
Once the game is built and launched, it will prompt a question for which level you want to play.
Just enter ``1`` , ``2``  or ``3`` , or another number if you created a different level in the *Levels* folder


## How To Play
You can move the playership using the ``up``, ``down``, ``left``  and ``right``  arrow keys
and you can use the ``spacebar`` to fire some bullets.   

Playing in *multiplayer-mode*? You can control the second (yellow)  bird using the ``z``, ``s``, ``q`` and ``d`` 
keys and you can hit the ```LSHIFT``` key to fireee!

## Dumb ways to die
- You will lose a point when an enemy hits you.  
- You will lose two points when you hit the ground or the super toxic sky. 
- You can actually fly on the ground and through the clouds, but 
the longer you stay there, the more points you'll lose. 
- You will lose two points when you hit or fly through a Pipe (sporadic obstacle)

## Easy way to win
- Each level has a certain amount of Enemy Waves. When you survive 'em all, you WIN!

 Enjoy!
